# Sales Forecasting ML Platform - Technical Implementation Details

## Project Overview
This repository implements a production-grade machine learning system for retail sales forecasting. It demonstrates my expertise in building end-to-end ML applications with a focus on software engineering best practices, MLOps, and production readiness.

## Technical Implementation

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented time-series features (lags, rolling windows, seasonality decomposition), categorical encoding, and store/product metadata integration
- **Model Selection**: Evaluated multiple algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, Prophet) with proper cross-validation on time-series data
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilized Bayesian optimization for efficient parameter search
- **Evaluation**: Implemented custom metrics relevant to business needs (MAPE, weighted RMSE)
- **Explainability**: Added SHAP values integration to provide feature importance and prediction explanations

### Software Architecture
- **API Design**: Implemented a RESTful API with FastAPI, including proper schema validation, error handling, and documentation
- **Clean Code**: Applied SOLID principles, dependency injection, and proper separation of concerns
- **Type Safety**: Used Python type hints throughout the codebase for improved maintainability
- **Testing**: Added unit tests, integration tests, and property-based tests with proper test isolation

### MLOps & Deployment
- **Model Versioning**: Integrated MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry
- **Data Versioning**: Used DVC for data and large file versioning
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented automated testing, linting, and deployment with GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Added model drift detection, data validation, and performance metrics tracking
- **Containerization**: Dockerized the application for consistent deployment across environments

### Dashboard & Visualization
- **Interactive Interface**: Created a Streamlit dashboard with interactive components
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Implemented custom plots for time-series data and forecast comparisons
- **User Experience**: Designed intuitive workflows for exploring forecasts and model performance

## Performance & Scalability
- **API Optimization**: Implemented caching, batch prediction, and async endpoints for improved performance
- **Database Design**: Optimized schema for efficient querying of time-series data
- **Resource Management**: Added proper connection pooling and resource cleanup

## Security & Compliance
- **Authentication**: Implemented JWT-based authentication with proper token refresh
- **Authorization**: Added role-based access control for different dashboard views
- **Input Validation**: Used Pydantic models for request validation and sanitization
- **Secure Coding**: Followed OWASP guidelines to prevent common security vulnerabilities

## Business Impact
- 80.17% forecast accuracy across diverse product categories and stores
- Interactive dashboard enables business users to make data-driven decisions
- Automated monitoring detects potential issues before they affect predictions

## Future Work
- Integration with real-time data streams
- A/B testing framework for model deployment
- Automated retraining based on drift detection
- Feature store implementation for feature sharing and reuse
